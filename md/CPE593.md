## COURSE DESCRIPTION

Data Structures and algorithms is an intensive introduction to brilliant solutions to classical problems with wide application across computer programming. First students learn to analyze code and identify the complexity of an algorithm. Then, students learn algorithms in many different areas of computing. This allows you to program better and faster. By knowing what optimal solutions are in a wide range of areas, it is possible to select the best algorithm for the job, and also to avoid writing it from scratch since it is often in a library. In class, you learn by writing many of these algorithms, but once you understand them, the big advantage is in knowing how and when to apply library routines. We only write new code when there is no library function that does what is needed. 

In addition, by learning the patterns like divide and conquer, dynamic programming, etc. that come up over and over again, you can gain insight into writing your own (new) algorithms when you need to.

This course covers data structures and algorithms with emphasis on
implementing algorithms in code and getting them to work.
Students must implement homework in either C++ or Java. On tests, you can write in C++, Java or pseudocode.

This course covers a wide range of topics giving a broad introduction to many areas, rather than in-depth in just a few.

## STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES
After successful completion of this course, students will be able to
* Analyze programs and algorithms and determine the complexity of the code 
* Identify the best possible performance based on limits to algorithmic efficiency * Write, debug, and test data structures 
* Apply the best data structure or algorithm for a particular purpose 
* Recognize and apply common approaches to high-performance such as divide-and-conquer
* Independently research new algorithms based on knowledge of the fundamentals
* Gain familiarity with other areas of computer algorithms for future growth and learning

## FORMAT AND STRUCTURE
* Classes involve live coding and creation of algorithms. The instructor will ask questions and you are encouraged to actively participate.
* Students are expected to participate and bring laptops to class, and take turns interacting on the screen with the instructor if asked to do so.
* There will be weekly coding homework and/or handwritten assignments.
* Quizzes and tests on paper verify that students know the material they have submitted as homework.

## COURSE MATERIALS
* Textbook(s): 		Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Adelman, Introduction to Alorithms 3e. Detailed course notes with more practical code in C++ and Java is al provided.
* Other Readings: 	Papers available in papers directory

## COURSE REQUIREMENTS
* **Attendance:**	Attendance is crucial for an effective learning but will not be graded. 
* **Homework:** 	Coding assignments will be submitted via canvas for individual single files, or via github.
* **Project:**		Depending on the semester, a final project may be substituted for the final.
* **Exams:** 	 	  There will a midterm and a final.

## GRADING PROCEDURES
Grades will be based on:
* Programming Assignments       (5 %)
* Homework Assignments	        (5 %)
* Quizzes		                    (10 %)
* Exams		              	      (80 %)
