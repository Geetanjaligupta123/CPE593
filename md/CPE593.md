2022 Spring Stevens Institute of Technology
* **Meeting Times:** 		Monday 3:00-5:30
* **Classroom Location:**	
* **Instructor:** 		Teaching Associate Prof. Dov Kruger
* **Contact and Office Hours:**	[contact info](contact.md)
* **[Resources](resources.md)**
* **[Course Web Address](https://github.com/stevensdeptece/CPE593)**

## COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course covers data structures and algorithms with emphasis on
implementing algorithms in code and getting them to work.
Students must implement homework in either C++ or Java. On tests, you can write in C++, Java or pseudocode.

This course covers a wide range of topics giving a broad introduction to many areas, rather than in-depth in just a few.

## STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES
After successful completion of this course, students will be able to
* 
*
*
*

## FORMAT AND STRUCTURE
* Classes involve live coding and creation of algorithms. The instructor will ask questions and you are encouraged to actively participate.
* Students are expected to participate and bring laptops to class, and take turns interacting on the screen with the instructor if asked to do so.
* There will be weekly coding homework and/or handwritten assignments.
* Quizzes and tests on paper verify that students know the material they have submitted as homework.

## COURSE MATERIALS
* Textbook(s): 		none. Notes provided.
* Other Readings: 	Papers available in papers directory

## COURSE REQUIREMENTS
* **Attendance:**	Attendance is crucial for an effective learning but will not be graded. 
* **Homework:** 	Coding assignments will be submitted via canvas for individual single files, or via github.
* **Project:**		Depending on the semester, a final project may be substituted for the final.
* **Exams:** 	 	There will be two exams and a final.

## GRADING PROCEDURES
Grades will be based on:
* Programming Assignments             (5 %)
* Homework Assignments	              (5 %)
* Quizzes		              (10 %)
* Exams		              	      (80 %)
